    This method's goal is: to print information about the error raised as exception.

    Parameters:

    error : exception
        A valid Python exception, such as one caught in a try / except loop.

    Returns:

    message : string
        A string containing the error string and its traceback, similar to IPython's output when an exception occurs.

    Example::

        try:
            tuna.io.read ( "non existing file name.fits" )
        except Excetion as e:
            tuna.console.exceptions.output_exception ( e )
