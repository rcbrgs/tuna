    Arguments:

    * data : tuna.io.Can
        The data cube.

    * elements_to_remove : dict
        A dictionary of elements that are to be removed from the data cube. Each
        key in this dictionary is the axis of the elements to be removed, and the
        value associated to this key should be a list of the elements to remove.
        For example, to remove columns 1 and 2, and row 13 of the input 'data',
        this argument should be {1 : [13], 2 : [1, 2]}. (The apparent discrepancy
        between the axis numbering and the "row index is the last" rule comes
        from numpy.where.

    * tuna.io.Can
