Tuna v0.10:
- Multithreaded pipeline (done).
- Wavelength calibration works correctly.
- Model fittings now use Astropy v1.0.2.
- Removed datacube class.

Tuna v0.9:
- Multithreaded pipeline (partially done).
- Fix FSR calculation on wavelength calibration (done, but check for possible sign inversion).
- Refactor logging using Python logging module and standard practices for Python libraries.
- Add function so the user can set the log file name.
- Refactor metadata extraction from ADA files so that numeric values are treated as integers and floats.
- Created tool to print a "history" of a pixel, as it goes through the pipeline.
- Refactor out the datacube class, integrating its functionality in Tuna cans (mostly done).
- Setup continuous integration with Travis and Coverall. 
- Increased test coverage of Tuna from 17% to 35%.

Tuna v0.8:
- Multiple instantiation of tuna now works reliably.
- Examples were refactored to exemplify tuna as a library.
- Cans metadata are now a Python dictionary.
- Arrays and metadata are directly accessible from the can object (no need for get_ functions).
- Airy fit automated. Refactor Airy fit using astropy fitters / models.
- Use Airy fit to replace suppressed data channels.
- Photon tables refactored to allow simpler translations.
- Wavelength now have only integers as valid values for a channel.

Tuna 0.7:
- Channel subset now interpolates values from neighbouring channels.
- Converting from ADA files now produces a photon table that is written to a FITS table.
- Airy function can now be fitted manually.
- Simplified Tuna API.

Tuna 0.6:
- Added tool to flip cubes along a dimension.
- Added tool to calculate difference between two cubes.
- Added tool to find ring center using arc chord perpendiculars.
- Renamed some modules to make them simpler and shorter.
- Parabolic fit now also returns the equation coefficients.
- Continuum now uses median instead of average.
- Log messages are now parameterizable in levels (debug, info, warning, error, critical).
